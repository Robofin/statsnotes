## Ubiased Estimation of Means

* Just like how on average Y^ = Y if Y^ is unbiased, on average the sample mean of a random variable is equal to the population mean of that variable.  That is, on average, μ^ = μ (assuming μ^ is unbiased).
* But how far off will a single estimate of μ^ be?  The answer is the **standard error** of μ^, or SE(μ^).
* Earlier we talked about variance.  The variance of μ^ is equal to the square of the standard error of μ^.  Expressed mathematically, Var(μ^) = SE(μ^)^2.
* The variance of μ^ is also equal to the square of the **standard deviation** of μ^ divided by the number of observations.  Var(μ^) = (σ^2)/n.  σ means standard deviation.

(What is a standard deviation?)
