## Unsupervised Learning

**supervised learning** - we know both X and Y for *n* observations. Based on this, we try to predict Y given X for additional observations.

**unsupervised learning** - we only know *X* for n observations and we don't know Y for any observations. Generally this means we are not interested in prediction, but rather different ways to understand X, both inside and outside X[1..*n*].

In supervised learning, we can assess our work using tools like cross-validation. However, with unsupervised learning, there is rarely any way in advance to tell if our work is correct.
