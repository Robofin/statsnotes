## Clustering

**Clustering** refers to techniques that separate data into subgroups, or **clusters**, wiht the goal of partitioning into distinct groups where similar observations are in the same group and different observations are not.

While there are many different clustering methods, the two most common are **K-means clustering**, where data are partitioned into a pre-specified *K* number of clusters and **heirarchical clustering** where we do not know in advance the number of clusters and end up with a tree-like representation of the data called a **dendrogram**.
