## Inference

* Inference is about understanding how changes in X affect Y.

* Goal is still to estimate *f*, but we don't need to make predictions about Y.

* Goal is to understand the relationship between X and Y.  This is about understanding the nature of *f^*.


#### Important Questions

* Which IVs are associated with the DV?  Often there are only a few important ones.

* What is the relationship between the DV and each individual IV?  Is it linear?
