## Statistical Learning

**Statistical Learning** is about understanding data.


#### Problem Types

**Supervised learning** involves models built for predicting an output based on inputs, using a **training set** of known outputs to benchmark against and learn from.

**Unsupervised learning** involves models built with no training set. However, relationships among the variables still can be found and used for predictions.

A **regression problem** involves predicting **continuous** or **quantitative** data (data that is in the set of real numbers).

This is different from predicting **categorical** or **qualitative** data (data that represents discrete categories, even if they may have numeric labels).  For example, age is continuous data, but school year grade is categorical data, even though the grades are in a numerical sequence.  This is called a **classification problem**.

A **clustering problem** involves figuring out which data points are similar to each other, without making a prediction.


#### Model Types

**Linear regression** for predicting quantitative values.

**Logistic regression** for predicting qualitative values.

**Generalized linear models** describes the entire class of statistical learning methods that includes both linear and logistic regression.
