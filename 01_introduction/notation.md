## Notation

* *n* represents the number of distinct data points.

* *p* represents the number of variables.

* Thus a data set with 3000 people and 12 variables will have *n* = 3000 and *p* = 12.

* *x[i,j]* represents the value of the *j*th variable for the *i*th observation.  *i* is used to index samples or observations (from 1 to *n*) and *j* is used to index variables (from 1 to *p*).

* **X** denoates a *n* by *p* matrix where element (*i*, *j*) is *x[i,j]*. The rows of **X** denote *p* variable measurements for the *i*th observation.  The columns of **X** denote *n* observations for the *j*th variable.
