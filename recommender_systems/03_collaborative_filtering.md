* **Collaborative filtering** infers that users behave in similar ways and that behavior of one user can predict behavior of another user.

* **Memory-based methods** (aka **neighborhood-based methods**) of collaborative filtering can find the _k_ most similar users to a user and average their ratings to fill a user's missing ratings (**user-based**). They also could find the _k_ most similar products to a product for that user and average those ratings to fill a user's missing ratings for a particular product (**item-based**).

* **Model-based methods** use other machine learning techniques.

* **Content-based methods** can recommend users content based on the metadata of other content, when user behavior is unavailable. These systems are good for recommending new products with no user interactions, but are bad at recommending for new users and are generally unable to make novel or serendipitous recommendations.
