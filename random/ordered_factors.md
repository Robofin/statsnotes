## Ordered vs. Unfactored Factors

* Ordered factors are in a particular order, and can be compared ordinally (e.g., greater than, less than, equal)
* Unordered factors are not in a particular order and can't be meaningfully compared ordinally.
* It's possible that ordered factors would provide more lift because they provide more information.
* It's dangerous to order your factors if there aren't any actual order, as this will provide unnecessary noise and make your model worse.
* Ordered factors could lead to overfitting if the order doesn't necessarially hold in future data.
