## Dependent vs. Independent Variables

* The **depdendent variable** (DV) is what you are trying to predict.  This can also be called a **response variable** or an **output variable**.

* **Independent variables** (IVs) are the variables you use to predict.  These can also be called **predictors**, **features**, or just **variables**.


## Notation

* The DV (there can only be one) will be denoted as Y.

* The IVs are denoted as X[1], X[2], etc.  X refers to the set of X[1] .. X[*p*].  There will be *p* such variables.


## Relating DV and IVs

* We assume there is a relationship between Y and X such that Y = *f*(X) + *e*.

* *f* is an unknown function that maps X to Y.  *e* is a random error term, independent of X with a mean of 0.

* *f* represents the **systematic information** X provides about Y.
