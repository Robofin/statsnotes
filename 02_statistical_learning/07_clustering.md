## Clustering

* Parametric and non-parametric methods are still **supervised learning**, where we can learn by training on data that contains our DV.

* However, we still need methods for **unsupervised learning**, where we do not have any train data (with sufficient data on our DV) to learn from.

* Another reason for **unsupervised learning** is when we're more interested in understanding relationships between variables or observations than making predictions.

* One of these approaches is **clustering**, or identifying groups from data.  Clustering is similar to classification, which we discussed before, except we don't have train data from which to derive probabilities of class membership.  Instead, we just look at the relationships between observations.
